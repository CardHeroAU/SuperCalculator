# How is Superannuation Taxed?

Generally speaking, the super is taxed at a concessional 15%. This includes 
1. The Superanuation Guaruntee (The super employer pays you, usually 9.5%), and
2. Any Superanuation Salary Sacrifice (What SuperCalculator estimates)

Based on the number, here is a comparison of how superanuation is taxed before and after salary sacrifice. 

[Table] 
(If more than $250,000, show *)

[Drag & Drop Bar adjusting %]

Technically the more Salary Sacrifice into Superanuation, the more Superannuation tax you pay. However since Superannuation is taxed at a concessional 15%, much lower than the xx% marginal tax rate, it's the less of two evil and hence results in tax savings.

Either way, you'll receive 100% of the salary (less the tax). The main difference is timing:

It mainly boils down to: Do u need the money, **now**? If not, consider putting into super.

Since it's highly subjective, please consider speaking to a financial planner for taylored plan.

# How to start?

The next step would be to come up with an arrangement with your employer.

This is usually a simple email to your employer indicating
1. I'd like to setup Salary Sacrifice for Superanuation 
2. The % or exact amount I'd like to sacrifice

That's it.

We're prepared a email template too, get it here.
