# What is Salary Sacrifice?



# Why would you sacrifice you salary for Superannuation?

Salary Sacrifice means setting aside some pre-tax money, and taking home less money.

This means instead of taking 100% of the salary (and possibly spend them all), receive 80% of salary right now (and happily spent it) and the other 20% is paid automatically into your superanuation.

Either way, you'll receive 100% of the salary (less the tax). The main difference is timing:

# Do I receive less if I salary sacrifice?

No. 

On the contrary, due to the tax savings, you could end up receiving more!

With the same income, you get to KEEP more of the money due to tax savings.

# How is Superannuation Taxed?

Generally speaking, the super is taxed at a consessional 15%. This includes 
1. The Superanuation Guaruntee (The super employer pays you, usually 9.5%), and
2. Any Superanuation Salary Sacrifice (What SuperCalculator estimates)

Based on the number, here is a comparison of how superanuation is taxed before and after salary sacrifice.

(If more than $250,000, show *)

[Drag & Drop Bar adjusting %]

Technically the more Salary Sacrifice into Superanuation, the more Superannuation tax you pay. However since Superannuation is taxed at a consessional 15%, much lower than the xx% marginal tax rate, it's the less of two evil and hence results in tax savings.
